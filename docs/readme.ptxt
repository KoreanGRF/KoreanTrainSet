1. About
==========
  Korean Train Set has train vehicles of the Republic of Korea (South Korea),
including various locomotives and metro vehicles in major cities of south korea.

Please refer to https://github.com/KoreanGRF/KoreanTrainSet/blob/main/docs/download_page/english.md
if you want to see the whole vehicle list that Korean Train Set adds.

Korean Train Set also adds a new railtype such as below:
  - [KTS] Light railway


2. FAQ
==========
Q. It's too few that train added (or) There's no (painted) vehicle what I want!
A. Every model of train showed up until v0.7.x, but now there displays only
   certain representative vehicle on v0.8.x. If you want to make other model
   which is on the same/similar line, first you make a vehicle that is
   similar with what you want, then change its model into 'Refit' button when the
   train is in depot.
   Nevertheless, if vehicle what you want didn't display, wait until 2013. Every
   train of Korea Train Set introduced from 1970 to 2013.

Q. Some of trains (eg. Line 1) does not appear in the purchase list.
A. First check that the depot is for "Electrified Railway". Most of trains of
   Korean Train Set is for the electrified railway. Secondly, try to turn the
   'Vehicles never expire' setting on in the (Advanced) Setting window. Or, it
   might be caused by using duplicated vehicle ID between KTS and the other grf.

Q. How to construct a train in detail?
A. We recommend like below. CTRL+Click to reverse the engine in the tail(enclosed
   by <> in the list below)

   (1) Subways:         [Subway locomotive] + [subway coach] + ... + [subway coach] + [Subway locomotive]
   (2) ITX-Cheongchun:  [ITX locomotive] + [subway coach] + ... + [subway coach] + <ITX locomotive>
   (3) Mugunghwa/Saemaeul(K8x00, K7x00):
                        [Locomotive] + [Mugunghwa/Saemaeul passenger coach] + ...
   (4) Demoted to Mugunghwa, former executive car:
			[Locomotive] + [Saemaeul passenger coaches] + ...
			(Change by the refit)
   (5) Saemaeul(PP):    [PP locomotive] + [coach] + ... + [coach] + <PP locomotive>
   (6) KTX:             [KTX locomotive] + [KTX coach] + ... + [KTX coach] + <KTX locomotive>
   (7) NDC:             [NDC locomotive] + [Mugunghwa passenger coach] + ... + [NDC locomotive]

Q. What can I do in the parameter settings?
A. You can make the train's speed faster, or change the capacity larger.

Q. It errors that the train is too short/long!
A. Some models(KTX, Saemaeul, subways etc.) must be more than two or four cars
   to run.

Q. Where is the passenger coach of ITX-Saemaeul?
A. You need to construct ITX-Saemaeul like below
   : [ITX-Saemaeul Locomotive] + [Saemaeul Passenger Car] + … + [Saemaeul Passenger Car] + [ITX-Saemaeul Locomotive]
   If you attach [Saemaeul passenger car] to [ITX-Saemaeul] engine, it changes
   into ITX-Saemaeul passenger car, automatically. If not, you can use refit
   button to change it.


3. Known-bugs
==========
+ The fact that the maximum speed of KTX is 331km/h, not 330km/h, and ITX is 181
  km/h, not 180km/h.
  : It comes from the problem of units between miles and kilometers.
    By the way, can you realize the difference of 1km/h? :D

+ Daegu Line 3 is a monorail, should not be run at Busan Line 4 (Light rail)'s track!
  : I already know about it but adding exclusive rails for each Light rails, such as
    Busan Line 4 (1700mm), Daegu Line 3 (Monorail) or Uijeongbu LRT (1620mm) is not
    nice for me. Furthermore there is no graphic sprite for a monorail track yet.
    So, for now, running Daegu Line 3's train on Busan Line 4's track is an intended thing.
