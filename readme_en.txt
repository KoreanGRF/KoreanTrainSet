3. FAQ
==========
Q. It's too few that train added (or) There's no (painted) vehicle what I want!
A. Every model of train showed up until v0.7.x, but now there displays only
   certain representative vehicle on v0.8.x. If you want to make other model
   which is on the same/similar line, first you make a vehicle that is
   similar with what you want, then change its model into 'Refit' button when the
   train is in depot.
   Nevertheless, if vehicle what you want didn't display, wait until 2013. Every
   train of Korea Train Set introduced from 1970 to 2013.

Q. Some of trains (eg. Line 1) does not appear in the purchase list.
A. First check that the depot is for "Electrified Railway". Most of trains of
   Korean Train Set is for the electrified railway. Secondly, try to turn the
   'Vehicles never expire' setting on in the (Advanced) Setting window. Or, it
   might be caused by using duplicated vehicle ID between KTS and the other grf.

Q. How to construct a train in detail?
A. We recommend like below. CTRL+Click to reverse the engine in the tail(enclosed
   by <> in the list below)

   (1) Subways:         [Subway locomotive] + [subway coach] + ... + [subway coach] + [Subway locomotive]
   (2) ITX-Cheongchun:  [ITX locomotive] + [subway coach] + ... + [subway coach] + <ITX locomotive>
   (3) Mugunghwa/Saemaeul(K8x00, K7x00):
                        [Locomotive] + [Mugunghwa/Saemaeul passenger coach] + ...
   (4) Demoted to Mugunghwa, former executive car:
			[Locomotive] + [Saemaeul passenger coaches] + ...
			(Change by the refit)
   (5) Saemaeul(PP):    [PP locomotive] + [coach] + ... + [coach] + <PP locomotive>
   (6) KTX:             [KTX locomotive] + [KTX coach] + ... + [KTX coach] + <KTX locomotive>
   (7) NDC:             [NDC locomotive] + [Mugunghwa passenger coach] + ... + [NDC locomotive]

Q. What can I do in the parameter settings?
A. You can make the train's speed faster, or change the capacity larger.

Q. How to make double-head train?
A. Please construct the train like below (please CTRL+click the part enclosed by <>)
   : [Locomotive #1] + [coach] + … + [coach] + <Locomotive #1> + [Locomotive #2] + [coach] + … + [coach] + <Locomotive #2>

Q. It errors that the train is too short!
A. Some models(KTX, Saemaeul, subways etc.) must be more than two or four cars
   to run.

Q. Where is the passenger coach of ITX-Saemaeul?
A. You need to construct ITX-Saemaeul like below
   : [ITX-Saemaeul Locomotive] + [Saemaeul Passenger Car] + … + [Saemaeul Passenger Car] + [ITX-Saemaeul Locomotive]
   If you attach [Saemaeul passenger car] to [ITX-Saemaeul] engine, it changes
   into ITX-Saemaeul passenger car, automatically. If not, you can use refit
   button to change it.



4. Known-bugs
==========
+ The fact that the maximum speed of KTX is 331km/h, not 330km/h, and ITX is 181
  km/h, not 180km/h.
  : It comes from the problem of units between miles and kilometers.
    By the way, can you realize the difference of 1km/h? :D

+ The fact that is impossible to make [8x00 locomotive] + [subways]
  : I used a complex method to make subway's appearance naturally according to its
    length. It crashes with locomotives so that subway cars appears abnormally.
    I wish I could fix it, but it seems to be difficult.
